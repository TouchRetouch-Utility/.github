## About TouchRetouch
TouchRetouch is a specialized photo editing application designed specifically for removing unwanted elements from images with remarkable ease and precision. While many photo editors include basic retouching tools, TouchRetouch focuses exclusively on this task, providing optimized algorithms and intuitive tools that make object removal accessible to photographers of all skill levels. The application excels at cleaning up photos by seamlessly eliminating distractions—whether it's removing a stray person from a landscape, erasing power lines from a skyline, deleting skin imperfections from portraits, or cleaning up product photos for e-commerce—all while preserving the natural look and texture of the surrounding area.

The application's strength lies in its combination of simplicity and sophistication. For quick fixes, users can simply brush over unwanted objects and let the intelligent algorithms do the work. For more complex removals, tools like the line removal brush specifically target linear elements like wires or fence posts, while the clone stamp allows for manual control over source areas. TouchRetouch processes images non-destructively, allowing for adjustments and refinements even after initial edits. This focused approach to retouching makes it an invaluable addition to any photographer's toolkit, complementing broader photo editing applications by handling cleanup tasks more efficiently.
